    <center><h1>Mastering Numeric Data Types in Python: A Comprehensive Guide</h1></center>
    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
        Numeric data types play a fundamental role in programming, enabling us to perform calculations, handle mathematical operations, and solve complex problems. Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language, offers a range of numeric data types to cater to different requirements. In this comprehensive guide, we will dive into the world of numeric data types in Python, exploring integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. By the end of this blog, you'll have a solid understanding of these data types, empowering you to leverage their power and unleash your programming potential.
    </p>
    <h3>Integers: Whole Numbers for Precise Calculations</h3>
    <p>
        Integers, as the name suggests, represent whole numbers without any decimal places. In Python, integers are defined by assigning a whole number to a variable. For example:
        <br><br>
        <code>
            x = 10
        </code>
        <br><br>
        Try it out:
        <py-repl id="numericrepl1" auto-generate="true"></py-repl>
        <br>
        Integers are commonly used in various programming tasks, including counting, indexing, and performing arithmetic operations. Python supports all standard mathematical operations for integers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    </p>
    <h3>Floating-Point Numbers: Handling Decimal Values</h3>
    <p>
        Floating-point numbers, also known as floats, are used to represent decimal values in Python. They are called "floating-point" because the decimal point can "float" to different positions within the number. Floating-point numbers are defined by assigning a decimal value to a variable. For example:
        <br><br>
        <code>
            pi = 3.14
        </code>
        <br><br>
        Floats allow us to work with more precise calculations involving fractional numbers. However, it's important to note that floating-point arithmetic may introduce some rounding errors due to the limited precision of computer systems.
    </p>
    <h3>Complex Numbers: Unleashing the Imaginary Realm</h3>
    <p>
        Complex numbers are a unique data type in Python that combines a real part and an imaginary part. They are typically used in advanced mathematical and scientific computations. In Python, complex numbers are defined by specifying the real and imaginary parts using the <b>j</b> or <b>J</b> suffix. For example:
        <br><br>
        <code>
            z = 3 + 4j
        </code>
        <br><br>
        Complex numbers open the door to a realm of mathematical possibilities, allowing us to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease. Python provides built-in functions to extract the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and compute its magnitude and phase.
    </p>
    <h3>Type Conversion: Transforming Data Types</a></h3>
    <p>
        Python offers the flexibility to convert data from one type to another. This process is known as type conversion or type casting. When working with numeric data types, you may encounter situations where you need to convert an integer to a float or vice versa. Python provides built-in functions like <b>int()</b>, <b>float()</b>, and <b>complex()</b> to facilitate type conversion.
    </p>
